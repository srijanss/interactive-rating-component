## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Lightweight frontend tooling
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) - Tool to transform CSS using plugins

### What I learned

- I tried to make this app with accessibility in mind.
- I learned about the importannce of alt attribute, figcaption element, lengend element etc. and how it makes the web app accessible to all users who uses different technology to access the web.
- I used web components to build both the form and thank you card. I find it easy to separate the required HTML, CSS and JS for each component.
- And I used history API to share the state between two cards. Also used history API to show form card on back button press.

### Continued development

As accessibility is ongoing process, I would try to improve the current solution.

### Useful resources

- [Web components - Custom State Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomStateSet#browser_compatibility) - Very helpful resource about CustomStateSet in web components.
- [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) - Very helpful to understand how history stack works. And how to maintain persistent data using history state.
